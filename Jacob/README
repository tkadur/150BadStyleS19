This piece presents a collage of many of the tropes of the FP Flavortext art
movement, which flourished in Pittsburgh in the early 21st century. The movement
was defined in cultural opposition to the then-dominant Imperative style, and
is considered a major force contributing to the eventual dominance of functional
programming and the widespread abandonment of the C language (and its
derivatives).

FP Flavortext artists principally utilized post-ironic memes to adorn and
highlight important techniques and principles of functional programming.
This piece is noteworthy for it's radical inversion of this relationship:
instead of utilizing memes as auxiliary adornment to functional content,
this piece employs functional content in support of a meme. The "I am Cow"
trope (which serves as this work's central focus) had already fallen out of
style by the time this piece was produced, but continued to serve as a
powerful symbol for the FP Flavortext community.

This work also presents the culmination of Strookes' experimentation with the
use of SML code as a canvas for dank in-jokes. Though the broader FP Flavortext
art scene was primarily focused on literary works (such as the flavortext
classics "JVB's Cool Beans Party" and "MkPotionMix"), the annual "Bad Style
Competition" (for which this work was submitted) served as a venue for the
community to showcase and celebate advances in the visual media. This work
is considered by experts to be one of Strooke's finest works in that regard.
